## Selection of Staff Members

### Criteria for selecting candidates

Selecting the right candidates for staff roles is a crucial step in building and maintaining a successful community environment. When choosing candidates for staff positions, the community leaders should consider the following criteria:

**Knowledge and Experience**<br>
It is important for candidates to have a thorough understanding of the community's rules and guidelines and experience in enforcing them. They should also be well-versed in the platform's features and best practices and have a proven track record of using them to create a positive community environment.

To ensure that candidates have the necessary experience and maturity, it is recommended that they have been active on the server for at least six months and that their account was created two or more years ago. This provides evidence that the account is well-established and experienced in utilizing Discord and its features.

**Communication Skills**<br>
Candidates should have excellent communication skills, both written and verbal. They should be able to communicate effectively with community members, other staff members, and external stakeholders. This includes being able to de-escalate conflicts, explain rules and policies clearly, and provide support and guidance to community members.

**Problem-Solving Skills**<br>
Candidates should have strong problem-solving skills and be able to think creatively and critically. They should be able to identify and address issues and conflicts in a timely and effective manner, and develop solutions that are in the best interests of the community.

**Time and Availability**<br>
It is essential that candidates have the necessary time and availability to fulfill their responsibilities as a staff member. This involves being able to monitor and moderate the community, respond to member concerns and complaints promptly, and actively participate in staff meetings and decision-making processes.

To ensure that the community is consistently monitored and moderated, it is recommended to have at least one to two staff members per three to five-hour time zone. This guarantees that there are staff members present while others are offline, ensuring that the community is constantly monitored and moderated.

**Professionalism and Ethics**<br>
Candidates should demonstrate a high level of professionalism and ethical behavior. They should be able to remain calm and composed in high-pressure situations, and treat all community members with respect and fairness. They should also be able to maintain confidentiality and adhere to the community's code of conduct and values.

**Existing Contributions**<br>
Candidates who have already contributed positively to the community may be considered for staff roles. This includes participating in community discussions, creating valuable content, or providing support to other community members.

By selecting candidates based on these criteria, the community can ensure that the staff team is composed of individuals who are committed, well-informed, and proficient in fulfilling their responsibilities efficiently. This can help to establish and maintain a positive and productive community environment and promote the growth and success of the community as a whole.  

### Evaluation process

The interview and evaluation process is a crucial step in selecting suitable candidates for staff roles. The following are the recommended steps that can be taken when interviewing and evaluating candidates:

**Application Review**<br>
At present, there is no existing application process for staff members. The current approach involves identifying potential candidates and conducting a screening process before proceeding with the steps outlined.

**Initial Screening**<br>
The next step is to carry out an initial screening of the candidate. This involves thoroughly examining their past messages on Discord to assess their communication skills, level of professionalism, and familiarity with the community. Additionally, it may involve checking their activity and engagement on platforms such as GitHub, Reddit, and others to gauge their interactions, comments, or contributions.

**Candidate Evaluation**<br>
Once the initial screening is complete, it is important to compile references and instances of the candidate's language, helpfulness, and contributions to ensure that the right individual is selected. This includes ensuring that they are following all the guidelines outlined in the [Moderation Guidelines Document, which can be found here:] (https://github.com/o3de/community/blob/main/process-docs-and-markdown/discord-moderation-guidelines.md)

By adhering to these steps, the community can ensure that the staff members are carefully selected based on their qualifications, abilities, and alignment with the community's values and culture. This can ultimately lead to a positive and productive community environment and contribute to the overall growth and success of the community.

### Types of Staff Roles and Their Responsibilities

Maintaining an organized community requires a team of dedicated staff members to ensure that everything runs smoothly. Below are some of the different staff roles that may be required within a community and their associated responsibilities:

**Moderation in Training**<br>
This is an introductory staff position for members who have been newly added to the staff team but do not yet have full permissions. This role typically lasts for 30 to 60 days, depending on the member's activity and helpfulness during this time. The responsibilities of this role include:

* Supporting moderators in enforcing community rules
* Learning the platform's features and best practices
* Observing and reporting rule-breaking behavior to senior staff members
* Providing assistance to community members
* Participating in staff meetings and contributing to the community's decision-making process

**Moderator**<br>
Moderators are responsible for enforcing community rules and keeping the community safe and productive. Their responsibilities include:

* Enforcing community rules and guidelines
* Monitoring chat and other community spaces for rule-breaking behavior
* Responding to member complaints or concerns
* Providing support to community members
* Participating in staff meetings and contributing to the community's decision-making process

**Manager**<br>
Managers oversee the day-to-day operations of the community and ensure that staff members are performing their duties effectively. Their responsibilities include:

* Supervising and guiding moderation staff
* Creating and enforcing policies and procedures for the community
* Handling escalated member issues or disputes
* Collaborating with other staff members to develop strategies for community growth and development
* Monitoring community metrics and performance

**Admin**<br>
Admins are the highest-ranking staff members in a community and are responsible for server configuration. Their responsibilities may include:

* Same responsibilities as Manager
* Server Configuration
* Server Bot Setup and Maintenance 
* Promotion of New Managers

However, it is important to note that Admins should be selected based on their ability to follow the guidelines outlined in this guide and the moderation guidelines. Failure to do so may result in community members and staff questioning the capabilities of the server staff.


By defining and clarifying the roles and responsibilities of each staff member, the community can function more efficiently and effectively. This, in turn, can lead to a more positive and productive community environment.



### Procedures for Promoting Staff Members

Promotions should be based on merit, and candidates should be selected based on their skills, contributions, and overall performance within the community. The following procedures can help ensure that promotions are carried out fairly and transparently:

**Determine the Need for Promotion**<br>
Before initiating a promotion, it is essential to evaluate whether there is a requirement for additional staff members in the specific role or to fill a vacant position. Once the need has been established, the community leaders can move forward with the promotion process.

**Identify Suitable Candidates**<br>
The community leaders should identify candidates who meet the criteria for the promotion. They can consider factors such as activity level, contribution to the community, behavior, and skills. It is important to ensure that the candidates have the necessary skills and experience to perform the role effectively.

**Evaluate the Candidates**<br>
The evaluation section of this document should be used to assess and evaluate the candidates.

**Notify the Candidate**<br>
Once a candidate has been selected for the promotion, they should be notified in a private message or call. The notification should include the details of the promotion, the responsibilities of the new role, and any changes in their privileges or access.

**Announce the Promotion**<br>
Once the candidate has accepted the promotion, it is important for the community leaders to inform the rest of the community about the new staff member. An announcement should be made that includes the name of the staff member, their new role, and any other relevant information. This announcement can be posted in the community's Discord announcements channel. 

**Provide Training and Support**<br>
To ensure the newly promoted staff member can fulfill their new role effectively, it is essential to provide them with adequate training and support. This can include access to resources, guidance from senior staff members, and ongoing support from the community leaders. The member will be assigned the "Moderator in Training" role, which allows them to learn and practice their new responsibilities while being monitored by senior staff members.

By following these procedures, community leaders can ensure that promotions are carried out in a fair, transparent, and systematic manner. This, in turn, can help to maintain a high level of trust and collaboration within the community and promote its overall success.

### Procedures for Demoting Staff Members

Demotions can be a difficult and sensitive process, but it may be necessary to maintain the integrity and efficiency of the community. The following procedures can help ensure that demotions are carried out fairly and with due process:

**Determine the Need for Demotion**<br>
Prior to demoting a staff member, it is crucial to identify the underlying cause for the demotion. This may be attributed to noncompliance with community regulations, low activity or contribution, or other performance-related concerns. The community leaders should assess the situation and ascertain if demotion is the suitable solution.

**Conduct an Investigation**<br>
If a demotion is considered necessary, community leaders should conduct an investigation to collect relevant information and evidence related to the issue. This investigation may include interviewing moderators, reviewing chat logs or other records, or consulting with other staff members or community members to gather information.

**Make a Decision**<br>
After carefully considering all relevant information and feedback, the staff should reach a decision regarding the demotion. The decision should be based on objective criteria, such as the severity of the issue, its impact on the community, and the staff member's past performance.

**Notify the Staff Member**<br>
After the investigation concludes, the community leaders must inform the staff member of the proposed demotion by sending them a private message. This message should include the reasons for the demotion, a clear explanation of the specific actions or behaviors that led to it, and any other relevant information.

**Provide Support and Guidance**<br>
If the staff member remains in the community, the community leaders should provide them with the necessary support and guidance to help them improve and grow. This could involve providing training, mentorship, or resources to help them succeed in their new role.

By following these procedures, community leaders can ensure that demotions are carried out with due process, fairness, and respect. This can help to maintain a positive and productive community environment, and promote the growth and success of the community as a whole.

### Conclusion 

To ensure that the community is structured properly, it is crucial that any new member joining the team as a Manager or Admin goes through the process of getting a Moderator in Training role and progresses through the roles of Moderator, Manager, and then Admin. Skipping these roles when promoting new members may raise questions about the server staff's capabilities to operate a safe and well-structured community. Therefore, it is important to follow the promotion process to maintain the community's integrity and functionality.
